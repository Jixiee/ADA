# Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make a series of choices at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. At each step, a greedy algorithm selects the best choice available without considering the consequences of that choice on future steps. Greedy algorithms are often used in optimization problems where you want to find the best solution from a set of possible choices. Here are some different greedy algorithms and the types of problems they are commonly applied to:
- Greedy Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees (e.g., Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Job Scheduling with Deadlines
